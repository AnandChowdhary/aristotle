## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The [`app`](/app) directory contains a Vue.js webapp built using Nuxt.js and the [`api`](/api) directory contains the Dockerized backend with RESTful APIs written in Python using Django, deployed to Firebase and an EC2 running Caprover respectively.

### Frontend

To build the frontend, head to the directory using `cd app` and install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the frontend on http://localhost:3000:

```
npm run dev
```

Firebase is used to deploy the frontend to https://aristotle-beta.web.app, built using:

```
npm run generate
```

### Backend

The [Dockerfile](/api/Dockerfile) is used by Caprover to build and deploy the app.
